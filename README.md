# Environment install
Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory of the project.
```python
git clone https://github.com/WangangCheng/t-CURLora.git
cd t-CURLora
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Our cuda version is 12.4, You can install pytorch from this [link](https://pytorch.org/).

# Data downloading
1. You can download the pre-trained weights at this [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jtkw2epEYVknGOSGKG0xnQpg4sacEs8j/view?usp=sharing), You can download the pre-trained weights from this link and put them in the `checkpoint/UNETR2024-05-23`.

2. Download our processed EADC data from Google Drive [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NY3ItOdsptI2lZ_iYvKR9PC6ApHSfdw7/view?usp=sharing), Or you can also get the source data on the official website [EADC](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

3. Download the LPBA40 dataset You can get it from this [Link](https://www.loni.usc.edu/research/atlas_downloads)

4. Download the HFH dataset You can gei it from this [Link](http://www.radiologyresearch.org/HippocampusSegmentationDatabase/)

## Data storage
Taking the EADC dataset as an example, first create a `Datasets` folder and place the downloaded data in it. In the `./Datasets/EADC` directory, there are three txt files: train.txt, valid.txt, and test.txt, which correspond to the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. You can manually modify these files to customize the dataset splits as needed.
The data storage location should follow the following method
- Datasets/
  - EADC/
    - sub1/
      - sub1_img.nii.gz
      - sub1_mask.nii.gz
    - ...
    - sub135/
        - sub135_img.nii.gz
        - sub135_mask.nii.gz 
    - train.txt
    - valid.txt
    - test.txt

Note:The label is not matched the image in th fllowing subjects:002_S_0938 (sub8), 007_S_1304 (sub35), 016_S_4121 (sub65), 029_S_4279 (sub85), 136_S_0429 (sub134). Then, follow the instructions in the train.txt, valid.txt, and test.txt documents to set up your training set, validation set, and test set.

# Preprocessing
```python
cd data
python preprocess.py
```
After pre-process, sub{i}_data_f32b0.pkl will be generated in each sub{i} directory

# Training
```python
cd t-CURLora
python t-CURLora.py
```
After the training is completed, the trained weight file will be in `checkpointd/UNETR2024-XX-XX`
Note that during training, the decoder part of the model remains trainable, and the U matrix from the CUR decomposition is also kept updatable, while the rest of the parameters are frozen. After training, the fine-tuned model weights will be saved in the checkpoint folder, distinguished by different dates, with each date corresponding to the day the model was trained. Training logs will be generated in the log folder.
# Inference
Modify the time in test.py, which is the training date
```python
python test.py
```
The inference process loads the average of the last four epoch weights. If you donâ€™t want this, you can set `multimodel=false` so that the inference process will load the weight file of the last epoch.

The inference results will be saved in the `output/submission`
# Evaluation
Before evaluation, you should modify the your_path part in dice.py and hd95.py files
```python
cd evaluation
python dice.py
python hd95.py
```
